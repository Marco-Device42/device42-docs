## Periodic Job View Page

Introduced in v15.14.00, the periodic jobs page can be found in the main menu, _Reports â€“> Periodic Jobs_. The Periodic Jobs page offers a quick view of resource utilization (RU) or Service Port (SP) job configurations. This makes it easy to exactly which you have scheduled, and when. The Periodic Jobs page also allows you to manage your RU and SP discovery jobs. You can easily disable or delete one or more jobs from this page:
