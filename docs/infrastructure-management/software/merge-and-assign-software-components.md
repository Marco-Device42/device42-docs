### Merging Software Components with the Same Name

To merge software components that have the same name into a suite, merge them together before merging them into a suite. A new component suite cannot have the same _name + vendor_ combination as an existing software component; it must have a unique _name + vendor_ combination.

For example:

- software component ABC with vendor Cisco (**ex. 1**)
- software component ABC with vendor MS (**ex. 2**)
- software component ABC-Suite with vendor None (**ex. 3**)

You can merge ex. 1 into ex. 3, or merge ex. 2 into ex. 3, with no problem â€“ however, trying to merge ex. 1 AND ex. 2 into ex. 3 will result in a validation error, prompting you to merge ex. 1 with ex. 2 before trying to merge them with ex. 3.
