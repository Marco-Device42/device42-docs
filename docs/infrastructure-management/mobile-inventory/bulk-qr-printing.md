Bulk QR printing can be done from the device or asset list view.  
Search/filter for your device/asset, select , and choose "Generate QR codes for selected items" from the Action Menu and click Go.

Then choose the QR profile.

A single page will appear that will print the codes according to the profile settings. It will help if "cut at the end" is selected in printer preferences.

Please don't do lot of devices/assets at once. We have noticed that performance suffers if too many devices are selected. Do it in reasonable bunches, e.g. upt o 100 at a time.
