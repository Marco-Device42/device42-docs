## Supported PDU vendors

Below is a brief list of Intelligent Power Distribution Unit (iPDU) vendors supported by Device42. For the most part, we cover all major vendors - however, should your device not be listed or not be discovered properly, please reach out to [Device42 Support](mailto:support@device42.com) and let us know.

We're always happy to add support for a customer's specific make, model, or iPDU. Simply [generate an SNMPWALK](administration/appliance-manager/collecting-snmpwalk-output-for-troubleshooting.md) for your particular device model, and send that SNMP walk to us (along with your request is best!). Our development team is happy to add support to Device42 within the next few releases _(we'll work with you to let you know a specific timeframe, but we release often!)_.
