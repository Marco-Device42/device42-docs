Device42 uses an analytics tool called Pendo to collect select usage information to help us better assist users, prioritize future product updates, and provide guided product tours for Device42 features. Our guidance capability will help Device42 users by directing them to the features that benefit them most.

You can use the Device42 Appliance Manager to disable the collection of usage data if you so choose.

- Log into the Appliance Manager, and select _Global Settings_ and then _Misc. Settings_.
- Uncheck _Allow guided product tours (shares usage data)_ and then click _Update Settings_.

Pendo will remain disabled unless you re-select the option.
