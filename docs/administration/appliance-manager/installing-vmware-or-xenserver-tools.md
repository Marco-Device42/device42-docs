Starting with v5.5.4, you can install vmware or xenserver tools in the Device42 appliance.

Steps are simple:

1. Add a CD/DVD Drive as additional hardware.(The default shipped VM doesn't have this)
2. Choose the option to install the tools
3. Option 9 from the vm console to install the update. If it does not recognize the CD/DVD, please reboot and try step #2 and #3 again.
