If you have complex/advanced routing needs for your Device42 appliance â€“ you can now add (or delete) those to the system from the console menu.

**Advanced Routing instructions are also available in [video form, here.](how-to-videos/add-a-new-route-to-device42.md)**

1. To configure advanced routing, choose option 15 from the Device42 Setup/Troubleshooting Menu (Log in to the Console of the Device42 VM to access this menu.): ![advanced-routing-option](/assets/images/advanced_routing.png)
    
2. To add a new route, enter option a. Print the routing table with option b.
