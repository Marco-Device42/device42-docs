## Introduction

Managed Resources are items identified and returned by Device42 autodiscovery jobs, and can be both cloud-based or on-premise. Managed resources include devices, load balancers, pool resources, storage arrays, etc. Managed resources also display their resource details, related resources, and topography map.

## View All Resources
