# SCCM Discovery

As of 18.11.00, SCCM Discovery is integrated into our main discovery jobs. Microsoft SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager or MECM, Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager), is a comprehensive management platform to manage and deploy software, applications, updates, and operating systems in an enterprise environment. SCCM provides administrators with a centralized and unified solution to efficiently manage a large number of devices, both physical and virtual, running various versions of Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.

If you are already using SCCM in your environment, the Device42 SCCM integration can automatically sync the hardware and software inventory (CI) data to Device42. SCCM discovery that can discover devices, OS, CPU, memory, network and software from SCCM.

SCCM Discovery can be configured with either WDS or WinRM.
