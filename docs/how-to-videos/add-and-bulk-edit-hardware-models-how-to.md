This is a simple demonstration that demonstrates adding a new Hardware Model to your Device42 instance, and then how to quickly "Bulk Edit" Hardware Models that have been autodiscovered and classified as "unknown". By default, when a device is discovered by Device42's auto-discovery, it is classified as type “unknown” (unless it is a virtual device). This is because the discovered device could be a physical device, a blade device or “other” type.
