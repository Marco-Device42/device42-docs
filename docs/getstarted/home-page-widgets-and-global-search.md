The Device42 home page Classic Dashboard features our updated widgets that give you a quick, clean visual look at your environment, making it easier to spot important trends and statistics. The home page also includes a Global Search function that lets you search your whole Device42 environment to find what you need quickly and easily.

## Widgets and Dashboards

- You can use the Dashboard drop-down to select one of the [Insights+](/reports/reports/insights-plus) dashboards to use for the home page instead of the Classic Dashboard if you want.
