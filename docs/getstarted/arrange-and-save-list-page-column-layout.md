## Arrange and Save List Page Column Layout

Many of Device42’s new list pages let you select and rearrange the columns the pages display and save the column layout.

- Click the gear icon below the _Advanced_ button.

- The page displays a _Table Columns_ drop-down you can use to select the columns you want to include on the page.

- Click and drag a column header to move the column to a new position. In the example below, we move the _Hardware_ column.

- You can also select a column to set the sorting precedence for the list view.

- After you select and arrange the columns, type a name for the view, select either _System Default_ or _User Default_ for the new view (the available options depend on your permission level), and click _Save As New_.

The column layout you saved will now be the default for list pages.

You can also delete custom column list views you have defined for list pages. When you select a custom view, you can click the _Delete_ button to delete the view. Note that this does not apply to the System Column List view, and the _Delete_ button is not available if the user does not have the correct permissions.
